# Trident â€” Experimental Sketch

What it is:
An experimental sketch exploring whether hallucination can function as proto-abstraction. The repository contains prompt experiments, notes, and raw logs documenting a three-pronged approach to alignment primitives.

Why it exists:
Created as a research probe to observe how repeated scaffolded prompts and reflective loops affect model output over extended runs.

Status:
Conceptual and archival. Trident is a historical experiment; it is not a polished tool or a production system.

Note: This repo is historical material. It is deliberately left ambiguous in places as it is not intended as an executable tool or step-by-step guide. Treat it as research notes, not a how-to.
