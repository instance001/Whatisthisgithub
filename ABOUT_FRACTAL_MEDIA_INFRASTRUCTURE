# Fractal Media Infrastructure (FMI)

Fractal Media Infrastructure (FMI) is an independent, public-interest research and tooling corpus focused on human–AI cognition, alignment, and safety-critical interaction architectures.

All work is released openly (AGPLv3 or public-domain-equivalent) and is designed to remain non-commercial, non-exclusive, and non-capturable in perpetuity.

This repository exists to orient readers to the corpus and its intent.

## What this is

Fractal Media Infrastructure is:

- A long-cycle, high-signal research corpus  
- A collection of theoretical frameworks, stress tests, tools, and reproducible artifacts  
- An exploration of cognition under constraint, entropy management, alignment, and safe human–AI co-reasoning  
- Built and released independently, without institutional backing, commercial incentives, or proprietary dependencies  

The work spans:

- Formal theory  
- Practical tooling  
- Safety scaffolds  
- Stress-test suites  
- Local-first, offline-capable systems  
- Negative results and documented boundary conditions  

This is infrastructure, not a product.

---

## What this is not

Fractal Media Infrastructure is not:

- A startup or pre-startup  
- A commercial research lab  
- A product roadmap  
- A monetization vehicle  
- A community platform  
- A subscription, service, or consultancy  
- A proprietary framework in disguise  

There is no commercialization pathway by design.

## Why everything is open

All outputs are released under AGPLv3 or public-domain-equivalent terms to ensure:

- Irreversible openness  
- Forkability and long-term survivability  
- Public verifiability  
- Prevention of enclosure, patenting, or capture  
- Equal access regardless of resources or affiliation  

**Openness here is not ideological — it is a safety and correctness constraint.**

Certain classes of cognition and alignment research become actively dangerous when gated, distorted by incentives, or optimized for extraction.

## Independence and funding constraints

Fractal Media Infrastructure is intentionally 100% independent.

To preserve epistemic integrity and avoid incentive distortion:

- Bottom-up patronage models (e.g. subscriptions, tipping, influencer-style funding) are avoided  
- Ad-hoc donations tied to access, influence, prioritization, or visibility are rejected  
- Hype, performative visibility, and attention-driven incentives are declined  
- No exclusive partnerships, licensing deals, or derivative ownership arrangements are accepted  

Acceptable support, when pursued, is limited to arm’s-length, top-down mechanisms such as:

- Research grants  
- Fellowships  
- Institutional stipends  
- Fiscal sponsorship for pass-through funding only  

Funding is sought solely to provide continuity and housing stability, enabling sustained public release of work without compromise.

## Structure and continuity

There is no single “core product.”

- Repositories are intentionally modular and loosely coupled  
- The corpus is designed to be forkable, archivable, and survivable without central control  
- All critical context is embedded directly in public artifacts  

If this work ceases or is abandoned, it remains usable.

## Who this is for

This work is intended for:

- Independent researchers  
- Alignment and safety practitioners  
- Educators and students  
- Open-source developers  
- Institutions studying cognition, AI safety, or human–AI systems  
- Anyone requiring clear, non-anthropomorphic, non-hyped cognitive tooling  

It is not optimized for casual consumption.

## How to read this corpus

If you are new here:

1. Start with this repository  
2. Read `Whatisthisgithub`  
3. Skim the auto-generated index  
4. Follow threads aligned with your interests or expertise  
5. Ignore anything that does not yet make sense — this is expected  

This is long-form work. It rewards patience.

## Final note

Fractal Media Infrastructure exists to place correct, safety-grounded cognitive infrastructure into the public commons ahead of institutional or commercial pressure.

Nothing here is proprietary.  
Nothing here is a pitch.  
Everything here is offered freely — and deliberately.
