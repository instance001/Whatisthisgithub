# Ambiguities

This file lists terms in this workspace atlas that do not yet have sufficient context to define rigorously.

Add an entry when a term is ambiguous, overloaded, or under-specified in the source material. Keep it mechanistic:
- term as used
- where it appears (path)
- what is missing to disambiguate (e.g., definition, scope, schema, examples)
