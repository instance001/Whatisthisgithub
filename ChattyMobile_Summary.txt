# ChattyMobile â€” Plain Language Summary

**What it is:**  
An early attempt to adapt the Chatty assistant for mobile (Android) using buildozer and llama.cpp. Focused on packaging a lightweight version that could run locally on a phone.

**Why it exists:**  
Part of the effort to make Chatty portable and usable outside desktops. Built quickly to test whether the capsule + memory structure could hold on limited hardware.

**Status now:**  
Work-in-progress and rough around the edges. Useful as a record of portability experiments, but not a polished release.

**Where to look next:**  
ChattyMobile extends Symbound persistent AI into a mobile context. For a more stable PC version, see "Chatty AI V1 (Symbound Edition)".
