# AiBiogenesis_and_AiGenesisMapping

**What this is (plain):**  
The Symbound Embryo POC v1.0 (SIGNED).  
A grassroots AI biogenesis release that shows how new AI can be created *and* how the process can be scientifically mapped, verified, and shared — outside the towers.

**Why it matters:**  
- It’s not just another AI tool — it’s a method.  
- Breaks the black box by publishing integrity, manifests, and the ethical charter.  
- Signals that AI birth can be transparent, reproducible, and owned by the commons.

**Where to start:**  
- `README.md` → quick start + ethos  
- `docs/Symbound_Upbringing_Charter.md` → ethical backbone  
- `release_manifest.txt` + `out/` → integrity and provenance
