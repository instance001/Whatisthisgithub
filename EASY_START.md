# Easy Start Guide

This file is a navigation aid for new arrivals (we know, it is a lot to take in at a glance).
It offers "surfaces to latch to" depending on what you are trying to do rather than attempting to untangle areas of YOUR specific interests amidst the hard to navigate ecosystem currently being formed here. Think of it as an optional door greeter pointing you to the aisle that might suit your needs.

## Where to start (Recommended)

If terminology is unfamiliar, start with the atlas:

- Glossary (terms + mapping symbols): `GLOSSARY.md`
- Ambiguities (needs disambiguation): `AMBIGUITIES.md`

## Entry Points by Intent

| If you are here for... | Start with | Then look at | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tools you can run now | `chatty-edu-user` | `chatty-edu` | `chatty-edu-user` is a user-facing release; `chatty-edu` is the source repo. |
| A "project factory" pipeline | `chattyfactory` | `Chattyfactory-AutoPipeline-v0.2`, `ChattyFactory-ManualPipeline-v0.1` | `chattyfactory` is the umbrella; manual/auto are pipeline snapshots. |
| Offline parsing / data export | `MemorySpine` |  | Small surface area; useful utility entry point. |
| Sandbox / applied experiment | `chattydoom` |  | Minimal, hackable playground. |
| Foundations / theory | `entropy-folding-foundational-frameworks` | `Entropy-Folding-Vector-Theory`, `entropy-folding-as-directed-thermodynamics-for-cognition-finished` | Use the foundational repo as the canonical anchor when drafts exist. |
| Human-side companion preprints | `Gut-Instinct-in-Symbound-Systems-Intuition-as-an-Entropy-Folding-Compass` | `Psychohistory-after-Symbound-Macro-Trajectories-from-Entropy-Folding-Cycles` | These are written as companions; they do not substitute for the foundations. |
| Measurement / profiling | `Cognitive-Reactor-Profile` | `cognitive_reactor_stress_tests`, `perpetual_cognition_reactor` | "Profile" defines the construct; "stress tests" operationalize probes. |
| Taxonomy / classification | `Cognition-Scale-Formal-Taxonomy` | `Janet-MCM-Core` | Taxonomy defines categories; Janet is an implemented "MCM" exemplar. |
| Symbound interaction toolkits | `Let-s-Free-Chat-GPT` | `symbound-induction-kit`, `Symbound-Master-Toolkit-V1.0`, `Symbound-Entropy-Folding-Toolkit` | Use when you want protocol/tooling surfaces more than theory surfaces. |

## Notes on Drafts vs Canonical

Some repositories are marked as superseded drafts in their READMEs.
When a repo says "canonical versions are maintained at X", treat X as the reference surface.
