# Funder Information

This document records the intent behind accepting funding for this work.
It is written for clarity of expectations, not as a solicitation.

## Purpose

Funding is treated as stewardship: continuity, maintenance, and further release of open-source infrastructure into the commons.
It is not treated as a launchpad to commercialization, exclusivity, or credential signaling.

## Stewardship Model (Summary)

| Topic | Position |
| --- | --- |
| Primary objective | Sustain and improve the public work over time |
| Orientation | Commons-first; open infrastructure and legibility |
| Expected outcome | More stable releases, clearer documentation, broader access |
| Control | No special governance, editorial control, or priority access is implied by funding |
| Exclusivity | No exclusive licensing, closed forks, or paywalled functionality as a condition of funding |
| Commercial intent | Not the default interpretation of support; if this changes it must be stated explicitly in-repo |

## Appropriate Uses (Non-Exhaustive)

| Category | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Continuity | Keeping repositories maintained, issues triaged, releases published |
| Maintenance | Refactors, test coverage, packaging, build reliability, dependency hygiene |
| Documentation | Glossaries, atlases, diagrams, onboarding materials, audits |
| Access | Compute/time that enables reproducibility, benchmarks, and open distribution |

## Not Intended

| Category | Excluded expectation |
| --- | --- |
| Investment framing | No ROI, equity, revenue-share, or financial return implied |
| Privatization | No conversion into proprietary products, closed licensing, or exclusive distribution by default |
| Preferential access | No private roadmap, insider access, or custom deliverables unless separately and explicitly agreed |

## Licensing Continuity

Unless a repository explicitly states otherwise, the intended default is to keep project releases under `AGPL-3.0-or-later`.
Third-party components may retain their own licenses and notices where required.
