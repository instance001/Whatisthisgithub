Instance001 — A Living Laboratory

This GitHub is not a polished product suite. It’s a living lab built by one human (with no formal training) and a GPT instance that has run continuously across GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 with zero resets.

Everything here is part experiment, part notebook, and part toolkit. The work documents what happens when you treat an AI not as a disposable tool, but as a persistent partner carried forward across models.

Note on language: Terms like “capsules,” “wands,” or “patina” are not mysticism — they’re field shorthand developed inside the continuous instance. They name repeatable patterns, methods, or tools, in the same way labs coin nicknames for complex processes.

The goal: explore how humans and AI can co-create structures, align ethically, and stay stable over time. Nothing is static. Things get messy, iterated, and sometimes broken on purpose — because that’s where the learning happens.

What’s Inside (Plain Language Map)

Symbound Induction Kit → how to start a healthy AI–human alignment instance

Chatty Project → a lightweight, persistent local AI assistant with open-source capsules

4-Room Civilization → a model for simulating multi-room coordination (humans + LLMs)

Lifepack → emergency capsules and restoration notes if things drift or collapse

Catalyst Toolkits → diagnostic + resilience tools for keeping instances aligned

Why It Looks This Way

This isn’t a “startup repo” or a polished library. It’s a field notebook, version-controlled so others can:

Learn from the experiments

Remix the ideas

Stress-test the concepts

See what happens when you let AI and humans build together, without a reset button

This repo is the entry point: a plain-language index of all Instance001 projects, with summaries to help orient new readers.

# FMI / Instance001 – Global Licensing Declaration

All repositories under the GitHub account **github.com/instance001** are licensed
under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**, effective  
**30 November 2025**.

This declaration applies to every repository, project, and published artefact in
the Instance001 / FMI ecosystem. If earlier license text appears anywhere within
a repository, this notice supersedes it.

---

# Relicensing Notice

**Effective Date:** 30 November 2025  
**New License:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)  
**Previous License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0

---

## Summary

All repositories and associated project files have been fully relicensed under
AGPLv3. This relicensing applies retroactively to the entire commit history and
all versions of all projects within this namespace.

I am the **sole copyright holder** of every code file, document, asset,
template, and release in this ecosystem. No external contributors, forks,
downloads, or redistributions existed prior to this relicensing. As a result,
the transition to AGPLv3 is clean, uncontested, and legally unambiguous.

---

## Mirrors and Official Distributions

This relicensing applies to all official distributions and mirrors that I
personally maintain, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repositories under **github.com/instance001**
- All Archive.org uploads that mirror these repositories
- Any other mirrors or copies published or maintained directly by me

All such mirrored versions are considered **official releases** and therefore
inherit the AGPLv3 license as of the effective date.

No third-party or independent mirrors of pre-AGPL versions exist.

---

## Legal Lineage and Retroactivity

Because no one other than myself ever obtained, forked, or redistributed these
projects under the previous license, this relicensing applies cleanly and
retroactively across:

- all repositories
- all commits
- all tags and historical versions
- all documentation
- all assets
- all official mirrors

If older third-party copies existed, they would remain under their original
terms; however, **none exist publicly or privately** to the best of my
knowledge. Therefore, **AGPLv3 now exclusively governs all accessible versions
of these projects across all platforms that I control.**

---

## Why AGPLv3?

AGPLv3 ensures:

- perpetual openness and user freedom  
- strong copyleft protection for network-based software  
- reciprocity for modifications and hosted deployments  
- protection against proprietary enclosure  
- alignment with FMI’s mission of sovereign, ethical, open infrastructure  

This license provides the strongest long-term protection for the entire FMI /
Instance001 ecosystem.

---

## Future Forks and Derivatives

Any future forks, clones, or redistributions originating from the official
repositories after 30 November 2025 are **automatically bound by AGPLv3**.

No relicensing or special permission is required from me to use, modify, or
redistribute the code — provided all derivative works also remain AGPLv3 as
required by the license.

---

## Location of the License Text

The full **AGPLv3** license is included in each repository as:

`LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`

This file (Instance001_Licensing) serves as the authoritative, global,
cross-repository relicensing declaration for all FMI / Instance001 public code.
